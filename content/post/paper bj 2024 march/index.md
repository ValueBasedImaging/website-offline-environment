This paper introduces the Radiology AI Deployment and Assessment Rubric (RADAR), a comprehensive framework for the value assessment of artificial intelligence in radiology.

1Ô∏è‚É£ RADAR adapts Fryback and Thornbury‚Äôs imaging efficacy framework for radiology AI, emphasizing the valuation from conception to local implementation.

2Ô∏è‚É£ It presents a seven-level hierarchy to guide radiologists, researchers, and policymakers through the comprehensive assessment of radiology AI's value.

3Ô∏è‚É£ The framework integrates clinical integration and cost-effectiveness, utilizing study designs like in silico clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, and health economic evaluations.

4Ô∏è‚É£ RADAR emphasizes local efficacy, highlighting the importance of assessing AI technology within its specific environment.

5Ô∏è‚É£ It aims to bridge the gap in the implementation of AI in clinical radiology, ensuring technologies are assessed thoroughly for their clinical and economic value.

The paper advocates for a dynamic approach to the evaluation of AI in radiology, aligning with principles of value-based radiology and addressing the need for a standardized method in comprehensive AI valuation.
