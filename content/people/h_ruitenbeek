# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform radiology by automating tasks and reducing workload, but clinical evaluation of these algorithms remains limited. Through collaboration between AI vendors and ErasmusMC, I aim to bridge this gap and provide valuable insights into AI's role in clinical practice.

 - External validation of AI tools
- Fracture detection
- Clinical value of AI implementation
