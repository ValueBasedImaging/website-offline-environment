# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My research focuses on the clinical implementation of AI technologies to improve the detection and follow-up of lung nodules in radiology. I aim to bridge the gap between AI algorithm development and real-world clinical practice by evaluating their impact on radiological workflows, patient outcomes, and healthcare efficiency. Through this work, I strive to optimize the integration of AI into routine practice, ensuring it enhances diagnostic accuracy and contributes to early lung cancer detection.
